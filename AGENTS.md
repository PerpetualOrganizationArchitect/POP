# Repo Instructions

This repository uses Foundry for development.

- `foundryup` has already been run. You should not run it again.
- Always pass the `--offline` flag when running `forge` commands (e.g. `forge test --offline`).
- Make sure to run forge build --offline before running forge test --offline
- forge fmt you run regularly and make sure to run it at the end when you are finished
